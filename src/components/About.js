            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                As this is the "About Me" page, I don't want to solely focus on
                web development. It's about who I am as a person. Despite
                studying physics in university, I'm a musician at heart and now
                also a web developer. You might be wondering, how do these
                things relate? Well, my first introduction to programming was
                through a Fortran course in physics, and although it may not
                seem like the most obvious connection, there are deeper ties
                between problem-solving in physics and web development.
                <br />
                <br />
                In physics, the language is mathematics, but it's not just a
                collection of formulas. It's about understanding the question at
                hand, analyzing data, and using problem-solving skills to find
                solutions. I believe that this ability to approach problems
                analytically is something that carries over into my work as a
                web developer. For me, problem-solving is not just a job
                requirement, but an enjoyable challenge.
                <br />
                <br />
                How about exploring the relationship between music and web
                development? At first glance, it might seem like an unlikely
                pairing, but for me, they go hand in hand. As a musician turned
                developer, I've created numerous web applications aimed at
                teaching music, benefiting thousands of students along the way.
                <br />
                <br />
                But my reasons for fusing music and development run deeper than
                just a passion for both. As a developer, I understand that I'm
                not just a code-robot, copy-pasting lines to create websites.
                Rather, it's our creativity that sets us apart, allowing us to
                bring value to our projects. And creativity isn't some fixed
                quality that we're born with - it's something we can nurture and
                develop. Studies suggest that playing with mud can boost
                creativity in children, while for adults, experimenting with
                musical instruments and notes can activate areas of the brain
                associated with creativity.
                <br />
                <br />
                In fact, I believe that leading a multi-dimensional life is a
                recipe for creativity. When we allow ourselves to explore
                different interests and pursuits, we begin to see connections
                between seemingly unrelated things, opening the door to
                innovation and discovery. It's why I'm passionate about blending
                my love for music with my skills in development - because I know
                that true creativity lies at the intersection of different
                fields and experiences.

                <br />
                Let's return to the technical side of things. I began my journey
                in web development in 2013 and gained experience working as a
                PHP and front-end developer for small companies in 2014. In
                2015, I embarked on my{' '}
                <a href='/rameshgar'>music startup project</a> and have been
                working on it since then while also taking on freelance
                projects. You can find more information about my music endeavors
                on my portfolio and view some of my coding projects on my GitHub
                account.
                <br />
                <br />
                Furthermore, I have completed numerous programming courses,
                which can be found listed on my LinkedIn profile.
